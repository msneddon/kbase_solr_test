       is an alias that causes solr to search appropriate packages,

       have your own custom plugins.

  <!-- Controls what version of Lucene various components of Solr
       adhere to.  Generally, you want to use the latest version to
       get all bug fixes and improvements. It is highly recommended
       that you fully re-index after changing this setting as it can
       affect both how text is indexed and queried.
